# TCP File Transfer System
## description
This project demonstrates high-speed file transfer between two systems connected over a Wireless LAN (Wi-Fi) using TCP socket programming in Python.
It simulates real-world data transmission between a client and server, while performing network performance analysis in real time.
The project also features a live throughput graph plotted using matplotlib, enabling visualization of network bandwidth utilization, packet size impact, and congestion simulation.
